# Module-12
In this repository, I predict determine the Credit Risk Cassification of loans and determine if they are healthy or high risk.

Answers to the modules questions:

**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?
**Answer:** This model predict healthy loans extremely well. The high-rsik loan is sub 90%, not awful but certainly not as great as healthy.

**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?
**Answer:** The oversampled data set yields about the same results, and the regression alone.
